* 64-bit Mac OS 
* 64-bit Linux OS 

### <a id='0-7-0-features'></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Enables <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> CF API v2 staging endpoints.
- Security enhancements.


### <a id='0-7-0-breaking'></a> Breaking Changes

This release has not been tested against Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition.

### <a id='0-7-0-known-issues'></a> Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

 - **Apps Manager** does not support inviting members.
 - **Apps Manager** does not support creating container networking policies for apps.
 - On TKGm v1.2.0 and v1.2.1, the `kapp` utility may fail to delete CF due to the version of Antrea used in those environments.  
 <br>
    To work around this issue, specify a filter to exclude Antrea resources during deletion:  

    ```
    kapp delete -a cf --filter '{"not":{"resource":{"kinds":["AntreaControllerInfo"]}}}'
    ```  

 - Staging applications fail during `cf push` if you exceed the maximum image label size when using containerd v1.4.0 and 1.4.1. 
 Containerd version 1.4.1 is used by TKGm 1.2.1. To reduce the chances of exceeding the maximum image's label size, 
 reduce the number of buildpacks used by the cf-default-builder.

 For information about the current app registry configuration file
 format, see [Configure the App Image Registry]
 (configuring-app-image-registry.html#harbor-config-file)
 and [Use a Different Image Registry]
 (configuring-app-image-registry.html#configure-other-registry) in _Configuring Your App Image Registry_.

 see [Generate Configuration Values](installing-tas-for-kubernetes.html#generate-configuration-values) 
 in _Installing <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>_.
