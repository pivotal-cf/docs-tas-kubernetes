This topic describes how to create and configure Kubernetes clusters to support
<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_short %>.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Before creating or configuring Kubernetes clusters,
ensure your environment and clusters support
<%= vars.app_runtime_short %>:

* [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](#tkgi)
* [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](#grid)

### <a id='tkgi'></a> Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> supports Kubernetes clusters in VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) environments.

Ensure the following before creating or configuring Kubernetes clusters
for <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> on TKGI:

* Your TKGI version is v1.7 or later.
* Your Kubernetes clusters have been created with the following characteristics:
    * The Kubernetes cluster has at least 5 worker nodes.
    * Each worker node has at least 2 CPU and 7.5&nbsp;GB of memory available for allocation.
    * The worker nodes in the Kubernetes clusters trust the container image registry that
    <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> uses to store buildpack-based app images.
    If the registry has a certificate issued from a private certificate authority (CA),
    this typically entails configuring the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to trust
    the certificate of that CA.
    * kubectl targets the cluster. To ensure that kubectl targets the cluster,
    run `tkgi get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME` after creating the cluster.


For information about creating a cluster with TKGI,
see [Creating Clusters](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/create-cluster.html)
in the TKGI documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> TKGI was formerly known as Enterprise PKS.</p>

## <a id='grid'></a> VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> supports Kubernetes clusters in VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) environments.

Ensure the following before creating or configuring Kubernetes clusters
for <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> on TKG:

* Your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment:
    * Is Tanzu Kubernetes Grid version is 1.0 or later.
    * Includes `metrics-server`. TKG does not bundle `metrics-server`,
    which is required by Tanzu Application Service.
    To deploy `metrics-server`, run:

        ```
        kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.6/components.yaml
        ```
* Your Kubernetes clusters have been created with the following characteristics:
    * The Kubernetes cluster has at least 5 worker nodes.
    * Each worker node has at least 2 CPU and 7.5&nbsp;GB of memory available for allocation.
    * The worker nodes in the Kubernetes clusters trust the container image registry that
    <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> uses to store buildpack-based app images.
    If the registry has a certificate issued from a private certificate authority (CA),
    this typically entails configuring the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to trust
    the certificate of that CA.

For information about setting up TKG, see [Installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid]
(https://docs.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.0/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-10/GUID-install-tkg-index.html).

After creating the cluster, run `tkg get credentials CLUSTER-NAME` to get the context name and `kubectl config use-context CONTEXT-NAME` to ensure that kubectl targets the cluster.

## <a id='verify-default-storage'></a> Verify that a Default Storage Class Exists

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> requires each Kubernetes cluster provide persistent volumes for its internal Minio blobstore. A default StorageClass resource in the Kubernetes cluster can dynamically provision the persistent volumes that TAS for Kuberenetes calls for.

Most of the Kubernetes distributed by the public clouds come with a default storage class. If you are using Kubernetes on a private cloud, you might need to install one instead.

To verify that your Kubernetes cluster already has a default storage class installed, retrieve the list of StorageClass resources in the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get storage class
```

Review the returned list of StorageClass resources:

```bash
NAME             PROVISIONER                    AGE
thin (default)   kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume   34h
```

* If the list includes an entry for which `(default)` follows the StorageClass name, then the Kubernetes cluster has a default storage class installed already, and you are ready to provision volumes dynamically. Proceed to [Installing <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>](index-install.html).

* If the list does not include a default, you must install one before installing <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>. See the [Installing a Default Storage Class](installing-default-storage-class.html) topic for information.
